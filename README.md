.Welcome to Standford Natural Language Processing study group. This is a study-guide for the 
course CS224n

## Who can join
Anyone. These are collections of open-source material helping fully understand the current
undergraduate curriculum at Stanford's NLP department.
 
## Current lecture:
- [Notes on lecture 4](./stanford-nlp/04-windows-nn.md) (Word Window Classification and Neural Networks, notes in progress)

## Previous lectures:

# Group project
**Proposal:** Create a daemonized Linux process that scrapes and stores twitter and quora data in a 
PostgreSQL database. Perform Bayesian sentiment analysis on the two data sources. 
```
P( TwitterSentiment | QuoraSentiment) = P(QS | TS) P(TS) / P(QS)
```
