# stanford-nlp-study-group
Welcome to Standford Natural Language Processing study group. This is a study-guide for the 
course CS224n. there are three task categories:

1. Provide **time-marker notes** for lectures 2-7
2. Complete Assigment 2 in Tensorflow
3. View Assignment 2 using Tensorboard 

## Who can join
Anyone. These are collections of open-source material helping fully understand the current
undergraduate curriculum at Stanford's NLP department.

## How to participate
There is no need to clone this directory to a local machine. It is large and serves as a reference. 
Edit thie repo using the github.com interface only (allow it to fork and delete the fork after pull request is complete.


## Timemarker notes
Timemarker notes are used to guide the user through the material. Each lecture takes about 4 hours of editing. The first two lectures are decent but require cleanup and more extra-curricular linkage. Forrh lecture is just started. Clean-up and finish of these is next step for this study group.
